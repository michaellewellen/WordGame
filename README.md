# Scope
This will be a first foray into MAUI.  The idea is to build a mobile app that involves mutiple word games. 

Initial Challenges:
* Finding an API with word lists, definitions possibly rhymes that can be scraped without copyright infringement
* Developing the different games
* Understanding how to publish an APK
* monetization considerations


First Game to try:  Wordle
